Overall goal
	I want to create a set of mods that add more depth to the game's existing mechanics.
	Slow the game down, add more technology progression, add more life to the NPCs etc...
	
	THEN give more control to the player - managing kingdoms, relationships etc...

Extended World Stats
	Track more stats that happen in the world.
		Teaches Stat Get
	Have a seperate window with each new stat in a list
		Teaches UI rendering
	
	Most Ruthless - ActorStatus() kills
		Human with the most kills
		Orc with the most kills
		Elf with the most kills
	Most Food Eaten
	Most Work Done
	Most Babies
	Most Weapons Produced
		...
	Most Agressive Leader
		King with Most Wars Declared
	Most Peaceful Leader
		King with fewest Wars fought
			King "Reign" / Wars Fought...
	Character Stats
		Houses Built
		Trees Chopped
		Children
	
Reduce Game Time
	Make the Game Clock run much slower, but still have units fun to watch
	
More Moods
	Add more meaningful moods to the game
	
More Items
	I want to expand the world with more items.
	Items should become an essential part of the game.
	Potions, tools, weapons, food, possesions, trophies
	
	Each item should be usable and beneficial to the user
	
	The goal here is to create tools to use in a further expansion/mod
		With a more simulated economy, more roles
		The NPCs will be able to become brewers, cooks, blacksmiths
			Producing items, giving items to allies in order to help
			Either in exchange for currency, or for war etc... 
		Wars fought become much more reliant on the actual strenght of the town, rather than just numbers
		This takes the existing tech tree to the next level.
	
Families
	Create "Children" that are visibily weaker/younger
	Connect Children to parents
