Overall goal
	I want to create a set of mods that add more depth to the game's existing mechanics.
	Slow the game down, add more technology progression, add more life to the NPCs etc...
	
	THEN give more control to the player - managing kingdoms, relationships etc...

Extended World Stats
	Track more stats that happen in the world.
		Teaches Stat Get
	Have a seperate window with each new stat in a list
		Teaches UI rendering
	
	Most Ruthless - ActorStatus() kills
		Human with the most kills
		Orc with the most kills
		Elf with the most kills
		...
	Most Agressive Leader
		King with Most Wars Declared
	Most Peaceful Leader
		King with fewest Wars fought
			King "Reign" / Wars Fought...
			
	Character Stats
		Houses Built
		Trees Chopped
		Children
	
Reduce Game Time
	Make the Game Clock run much slower, but still have units fun to watch
	
More Moods
	Add more meaningful moods to the game
	
Families
	Create "Children" that are visibily weaker/younger
	Connect Children to parents
